NumPy is good
Powerful n-dimensional arrays, vectoriztion, indexing broadcasting, de-facto standars of array computiing
Numerical computing tools, comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routes, fourtier transforms and more
Performant, the core of NumPy is well-optimized C code

NumPy stands for numerical Python and it is more than array library]
NumPy is the fundamental package required for high performance computing and data analysis

"""NumPy ndArray vs. List
ndarray stands for N-dimentionsal array object.  It is a fast, flexiable containers for large data sets in Python
Whatever you see in "array", "NumPy array", or "ndarray" in a python conext, basically they all refer to the same thing: the ndarray object
NumPy-based algorithms are generally 10 to 100 times faster than their pure Python counterparts and use significantly less memory
NumPy arrays are more compact than lists, i.e. they take much less storage space than lists

"""Create NumPy Array (1D, 2D, and 3D)
array1d = numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
array2d = numpy.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
